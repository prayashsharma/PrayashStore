<h3>@ViewBag.Title.</h3>

<p>This is a simple fictional ecommerce full stack application. It was created in ASP.NET 4.5 framework using the following: C#, Javascript, CSS, HTML. This application uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) as an architectural patten and Entity Framework as the object-relational mapper.
<br />
This application also utilizes the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Bootstrap 3.3.7</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
        <li>Autofac - IoC container</li>
        <li>Toastr - Notifications</li>
        <li>FontAwesome - Icons</li>
        <li>Sendgrid - Email delivery service</li>
        <li>bxSlider - jQuery content slider</li>
    </ul>
<br/>
This was my first attempt to build full stack ASP.NET web application so please feel free to contact me if I have missed anything or if you would like to make any suggestions.
<br/><br/>
Thank you,
