This is a simple fictional ecommerce full stack application. It was created in ASP.NET 4.5 framework using the following: C#, Javascript, CSS, HTML. This application uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) as an architectural patten and Entity Framework as the object-relational mapper. 
This application also utilizes the following:

Bootstrap 3.3.7,
jQuery,
Autofac - IoC container,
Toastr - Notifications,
FontAwesome - Icons,
Sendgrid - Email delivery service,
bxSlider - jQuery content slider
.
This was my first attempt to build full stack ASP.NET web application so please feel free to contact me if I have missed anything or if you would like to make any suggestions. 

Thank you,
